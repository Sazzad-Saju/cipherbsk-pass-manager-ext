# Cipher BSK - Privacy Policy

Welcome to the **Cipher BSK** Privacy Policy page. This document outlines the measures we take to protect your privacy and ensure the security of your data.

## Privacy Policy Overview

At **Cipher BSK**, your privacy is our priority. Below, we describe how we protect your data and maintain transparency throughout the process:

### Key Points

- **No Tracking:**  
  We don’t collect personal data or use analytics tools to track your usage.

- **Local Encryption:**  
  All data is encrypted on your device using your master password. We never see or store your data.

- **Encrypted Data Only:**  
  When you save any data, we only receive the encrypted content — we never store plaintext.

- **Session Security:**  
  Your master password is securely managed with a 12-hour expiration for protection.

- **Encryption Control:**  
  You are in control of how your data is encrypted, including choosing the number of encryption rounds. While one round is usually sufficient, more rounds can add extra protection.

- **Security Enforcement:**  
  Saving is blocked if encryption rounds are set to zero (plaintext). This ensures that encryption is always enforced for your protection.

- **User-Controlled Output:**  
  You determine how your data is encrypted and how it appears after encryption.

- **Firebase Security:**  
  We use Firebase for authentication and storage. Only encrypted data is stored.

- **Open Source:**  
  Our code is open-source and publicly auditable to ensure transparency.

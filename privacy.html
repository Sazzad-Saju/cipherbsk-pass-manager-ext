    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is our priority. Here's how we protect it.</p>

    <h3>Data Collection & Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We don't collect personal data or use analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All data remains on your device. We use Chrome's local storage for
            session management, but this data is encrypted and temporary.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Security:</strong> Your master password is temporarily stored in memory and local storage
            (encrypted) for session management. Sessions automatically expire after 12 hours for security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Encryption & Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted on your device using your master password. We never
            see or store it.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted Data Only:</strong> When you save, we receive only encrypted content â€” never plaintext.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Chunked Encryption:</strong> Large data is automatically split into smaller chunks for secure
            processing, ensuring stable encryption without memory issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption Control:</strong> You choose the number of encryption rounds. One round is usually
            enough, but more can add extra protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Enforcement:</strong> Saving is blocked if encryption rounds are set to zero (plaintext).
            We enforce encryption to protect your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Control & Transparency</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Controlled Output:</strong> You control how your data is encrypted and how it looks after
            encryption.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> You can manually log out at any time to clear your session. Sessions
            automatically expire for security.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Recovery:</strong> If a session expires, any unsaved data remains encrypted and secure.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Our code is public and auditable for transparency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Firebase Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We use Firebase Authentication for secure user management. Only your email
            is stored by Firebase for account purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Encrypted data is stored in Firebase Firestore. Firebase never receives or
            stores your master password or unencrypted data.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Privacy:</strong> Our Firebase implementation follows Google's privacy standards. You can
            review Firebase's privacy policy at <a
                href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use Chrome's storage API for session management. This data is encrypted
            and automatically cleared on session expiration.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Large data is processed in chunks to ensure stable performance and
            security.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Cleanup:</strong> All sensitive data is automatically cleared from memory when you log out
            or when your session expires.</li>
    </ul>
